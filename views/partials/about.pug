    ## About Me

    Hi there, I’m Erik - a guy who makes Video Games and Websites in Mid Wales in the UK.

    I wanted to make Video Games from the day I played Sonic the Hedgehog on the SEGA Master System, but back then I would spend most of my time drawing. We didn’t have a computer, programming was a complete mystery.

    At age sixteen I got my hands on Flash and taught myself how to Animate with it. I had a lot of fun doing this and eventually got to be pretty good at it. I added some play / pause / rewind / etc buttons to my movies, and with some help from my friend [Lee Comstock](http://volcanicpenguin.st) I slowly built up my knowledge of ActionScript until I felt confident that I could make a Video Game with it. The first attempts were failiures, but each time I got better at it.

    My brother [Zeke Watson](http://zekewatson.tumblr.com/) has a similar, parallel story and after I got back from taking a Web Development course in University we worked together to make, and importantly, to finish some games. We released them under the name [BumbleBirds](http://bumblebirds.com). I consider this some of the best work of my life.
